# # Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor
# # (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer)
# # and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).



# From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, double the value of every second digit.
# If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product
# (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
# Take the sum of all the digits.
# If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula;
#  else it is not valid.
